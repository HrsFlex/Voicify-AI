## Inspiration
Voicify AI was inspired by the desire to make learning accessible and empower self-reflection. Public speaking isn’t just a skill—it’s a powerful tool to inspire and influence. Yet, starting the journey to self-improvement can feel overwhelming.

With Voicify AI, we harness technology to simplify learning, break barriers, and help everyone find their voice with confidence.

## What it does
Voicify AI isn’t just a public speaking app—it’s your complete guide to mastering the art of communication. From start to finish, it supports your learning journey by providing detailed feedback and analytics as you upload videos to enhance every aspect of your public speaking skills.

Get started on the landing page by signing up for a free account, with your information securely encrypted using JWT. Upload a video for analysis, and Voicify AI takes care of the rest: compressing the video with ffmpeg, transcribing it via Google Cloud’s Speech-to-Text, and leveraging cutting-edge technology like Vertex AI Vision, Gemini, and LangChain to provide tailored feedback, key insights, and personalized course outlines. The platform even uses the YouTube API to recommend the most relevant educational videos for your growth.

Users can view results, access past recordings, and edit lesson plans directly from the dashboard—streamlining the process of finding personalized resources and eliminating barriers to learning new skills efficiently. Voicify AI makes mastering public speaking easier, smarter, and more accessible than ever.

## How we built it
We built Voicify AI using a powerful stack of cutting-edge technologies:

Front-End
Next.js: The foundation for building a responsive and modern front end 🧱
Vercel: Hosting and managing seamless deployments 💻

Gemini API: Generating feedback and tailored course content 🤖
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text: Converting speech into transcriptions 🎤
YouTube Search API: Recommending the best educational videos 🎥
Voicify AI combines these technologies to deliver a seamless, efficient, and transformative learning experience for mastering public speaking.


## Challenges we ran into
Our journey in building a scalable and efficient application was filled with challenges. Managing the high volume of API calls to Vertex AI and Gemini required meticulous prompt engineering and rigorous testing to minimize hallucinations. Additionally, integrating and testing a variety of essential frameworks and libraries posed its own set of complexities.

Through persistence and innovation, we overcame these hurdles to create a seamless and reliable solution.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As a cohesive team with diverse experiences, we were thrilled to create an app that truly leveraged our collective skill sets. By utilizing Google’s Developer Tools, we overcame challenges we initially thought were infeasible, completing our application in under 24 hours.

The seamless integration of different tools enabled us to reduce inefficiencies and enhance scalability, resulting in a flexible system built with reusable and interchangeable modules.

## What we learned
The journey to our final idea was a long and evolving process. What began as a simple speech-to-text feature gradually developed into a creative and impactful solution. We learned that innovation often arises from the most unexpected sources—ideas we might initially dismiss as laughable can turn out to be the most transformative.



## What's next for Voicify AI
RAG and Data Analysis 📈
